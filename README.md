# Pong Game

Welcome to Pong! First, you want to begin by cloning this repository into any IDE of your choice.
To clone: `git clone enter_clone_url`
Ensure that your JDK is installed and declared in the project. Next, run the project by clicking the play button in your IDE.

How to play:

For the left player, 'W' is in charge of moving the paddle up and 'S' is in charge of moving the paddle down.
For the right player, 'up arrow' is in charge of moving up and 'down arrow' is in charge of moving down.

Once the ball gets past a paddle, a point is rewarded to the player that hit the ball. The score is updated and a new game instantly begins.
To stop playing, close the window or stop running the program from the IDE.
